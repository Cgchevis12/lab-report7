The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar ListExamples.java command was 4 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamples command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.

4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
